Mobile Stack Hooks allows developers to extend an app's functionality (_e.g._, the Valora wallet) by writing short programs called "hooks". These hooks are called in response to certain in-app or blockchain events and are used to provide the application with additional information and features.

Check out the [Hooks documentation](https://docs.valora.xyz/hooks/) for more information.

Currently, this repository contains position pricing and shortcut hooks.

## Developing Hooks

2. Run `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.

### Position Pricing

See the [documentation](docs/types/position.md) for developing position pricing hooks.
